 My C# Projects

This repository contains the C# projects I completed while studying software development at the Academy of Learning Career College. These projects helped me learn the basics of C#, .NET, object-oriented programming, MVC, Entity Framework, and working with databases. I’m still learning, but I’m proud of the progress I’ve made so far.
